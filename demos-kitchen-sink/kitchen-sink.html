          <h3>Semantic Inline Elements</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Although some elements may appear to have some default styling by the
          browser, HTML should always be used <i>semantically</i>, meaning that they
          are used based on the purpose they serve instead of their aesthetic look.
          <strong>It's imperative for you to use CSS for all aesthetic
            purposes.</strong>
        </p>
        <p><b>This is some text that you should look at, but isn't necessarily
            important.</b> You also <em>need</em> to understand that
          <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> is used
          to emphases words or a phrase that are more important than their surroundings.

          <h3>Some elements are useful when styling</h3>
        </header>
        <p>When a piece of content has no specific purpose, or there is no other better
          semantic HTML element to use, <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and
          <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> can be quite useful.
        </p>
