            The action attribute contains the URI of the program that processes the data sent via the form. In other words, it is where you are
            sending the form data to be processed. The action is invoked when the form is submitted. 
        </section>

        For example, the following form's <code>action</code> is set to "http://httpbin.org/post". When the submit button is toggled, the form data will be sent to that endpoint.

        <form action="http://httpbin.org/post" method="POST" accept-charset="UTF-8">
            <label for="name">Enter your name:</label> <br/>
            <input type="text" id="name" name="name"> <br/>
            <input type="submit" value="submit">
        </form>

    </body>
